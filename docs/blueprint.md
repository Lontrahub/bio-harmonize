## Style Guidelines:

- Dark Scheme: Background color: Very dark blue-gray (#22272e) for a professional look with less glare.  This is almost but not quite black, to permit more subtle shading effects.
- Light Scheme: Background color: Off-white (#f9f9f9) for a clean and modern look, providing high contrast.
- Primary color: Teal (#45b3a9) used for main interactive elements like buttons, progress bars, and active states.  It's used in both light and dark schemes, which calls for an unconventional tint and shade.
- Accent color: Soft peach (#ef8354) as a contrasting accent for highlights and secondary actions to draw attention. The purpose of this color is to give emphasis.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text providing readability, paired with 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headings to add a touch of elegance.
- Icons: Use simple, outline-style icons for navigation and actions, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
- Responsive Layout: Use a responsive design to ensure the app looks good on all devices. Employ a grid system for consistent spacing and alignment.
